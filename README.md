# Bobby
A glitchy drum machine for the **Korg Nu:Tekt NTS-1** featuring 8 and 12-bit samples squeezed into 20kB of memory, mapped out in different combinations to achieve a limited form of polyphony.
## Usage
A + B encoders are used to control the volume for the two sets of sample groups (kick + snare + other / hi-hats).
Accessing the oscillator parameters, each group can also be tuned individually in addition to applying random repeat and pitch.

Note that a sample will not be triggered until a note off event has been received for the previous one.

A short demonstration can be viewed here:
